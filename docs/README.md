# GymFit Documentation Index

This is the only documentation index. Current source and applied migrations override documentation if a conflict is found.

## Which file should I read?

- New teammate: [root README](../README.md), then [Developer Workflow](DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md).
- Current project state: [PROJECT_STATUS.md](../PROJECT_STATUS.md).
- What to build next: [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and [TASK-008 Implementation Specification](TASK-008_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md).
- Database work: [Database and Migrations](DATABASE_AND_MIGRATIONS.md).
- API/security work: [API and Authorization](API_AND_AUTHORIZATION.md).
- Historical TASK-007 evidence: [TASK-007 Final Handoff](TASK-007_FINAL_HANDOFF.md) and [TASK-007 Completion](../logs/TASK-007_COMPLETION.md).

Curated project history is under [`logs/`](../logs/README.md). Runtime logger output belongs under ignored `backend/logs/` and is never documentation.
