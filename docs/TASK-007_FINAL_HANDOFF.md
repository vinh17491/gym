# TASK-007 Final Handoff

Final verdict: **FULL_TASK_007_COMPLETE**. Acceptance date: 2026-07-14 Asia/Saigon. Final branch: `007c-order-management`; commit: `427ad52996961648ffc622ca1bf2999a5aab3df4`.

- 007A delivered Product/Image, ProductVariants/options, per-variant Inventory and public catalog.
- 007B delivered Admin Product, Category, Brand, Variant, Inventory and Order management with backend Admin authorization.
- 007C delivered variant-aware Cart/Checkout, customer Orders/history, reservation expiration, order/payment histories, refund-safe cancellation, Bank QR readiness and Gmail notifications.

Migrations `0001`-`0005` are applied: catalog foundation, catalog/inventory management, order foundation, payment history, and reservation expiration. The invariant is `available = on_hand - reserved`. Reservation, cancel, expiration, delivery and manual-refund transitions passed runtime acceptance.

Real Gmail delivery (four flows), real Bank configuration and QR HTTP response passed. Authenticated customer checkout with a non-default variant and full Admin order list/detail/payment/order transitions passed browser acceptance. Member Admin API was 403, guest was 401, and customer ownership/IDOR checks passed.

Acceptance databases/services/artifacts were cleaned. Canonical `GYMFIT_DB` was not mutated by acceptance; final counts were Products 167, ProductVariants 167, Inventory 167, ProductImages 1, Orders 0, PaymentStatusHistory 0. There are no remaining TASK-007 blockers.

| Acceptance area | Result |
|---|---|
| Backend build/typecheck and lint | PASS (58 pre-existing lint warnings, 0 errors) |
| Frontend TypeScript and production build | PASS (non-blocking chunk-size warning) |
| Product/Variant/Inventory/Order/Payment runtime | PASS |
| Real Gmail delivery (four flows) | PASS |
| Real Bank configuration and QR HTTP response | PASS |
| Customer checkout/order browser flow | PASS |
| Admin order/payment browser flow | PASS |
| Authorization and cross-user IDOR | PASS |
| Acceptance cleanup and canonical integrity | PASS |

Retained limitations: manual bank reconciliation/refund, intentionally limited verified ProductImage coverage, and legacy modules outside TASK-007 refactoring scope. Intermediate TASK-007 prompts, source reports and acceptance reports are obsolete after their verified facts were merged here; Git history preserves them.

**Do not rerun TASK-007 finalization prompts unless a real regression exists.**
