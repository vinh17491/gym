## Relevant legacy modules

Mounted APIs include public/authenticated Plans, Coaches, Bookings, Videos, Exercises; and authenticated Referral, Coupons, Loyalty, CRM, Tickets, Invoices, Audit, Analytics, Revenue, Backup and Media. Their route files are authoritative. Existing Exercises provides public list/taxonomy/detail plus Admin/Coach update; it is a Discovery Gate input, not proof TASK-008 is implemented. Membership payment under Plans is separate from Product Order payment.

## Planned, not implemented

TASK-008 plans Admin/Coach Exercise and Program CRUD/builder APIs; Admin/Coach assignment APIs; Member self assignment/schedule/session/set-log APIs; and Member/Coach/Admin progress APIs. Exact paths must be finalized after Discovery and must not be advertised as current routes.

## Authorization and response principles

JWT bearer authentication supplies the authenticated identity and role (`ADMIN`, `COACH`, `MEMBER`). Backend middleware and owner-filtered service queries are authoritative; frontend guards are navigation UX only. Customer Order endpoints derive ownership from JWT and reject cross-member access. Admin override exists only in Admin routes. New TASK-008 Coach access must require an active Coach-Member scope.

Validation failures use 400-class responses, missing/invalid authentication uses 401, insufficient role/scope uses 403, missing resources use 404, business transition/concurrency conflicts use 409, and incomplete required external configuration may use 503. Central error handling owns unexpected failures. SQL inputs must remain parameterized; pagination, filtering and sorting require validation/allowlists.

Order and Payment histories are immutable normal-flow audit data. Email is attempted after committed commerce state and cannot roll back the transaction. Planned TASK-008 workout/progress APIs are **PLANNED, NOT IMPLEMENTED** and must enforce Member ownership, Coach scope, privacy and concurrency rules from the specification.
