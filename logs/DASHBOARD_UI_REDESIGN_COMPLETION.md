# Dashboard UI Redesign Completion

Date: 2026-07-16

Implemented `GYMFIT COMMAND CENTER` on `feat/dashboard-ui-redesign` with a frontend-only scope. Backend business logic, API contracts, RBAC policy, database, and migrations were unchanged.

- TypeScript: PASS.
- Production build: PASS; existing Vite chunk-size warning remains non-blocking.
- Admin: typed revenue/trend/membership contracts, VND formatting, no invented trend.
- Coach: scoped navigation and truthful unavailable schedule/member states; no hardcoded upcoming-session zero.
- Member: self-scoped bookings/loyalty only; no business KPI or fake recent activity.
- Shared shell/components: PASS for dark neutral surfaces, responsive states, keyboard focus, reduced motion, and real links.
- Login root cause: `TEST_HARNESS_DEFECT` in the prior browser/process context. Direct backend login, explicit frontend-origin proxy login and real React form login all passed on a fresh isolated stack; no source fix was required.
- Browser acceptance: Member, Coach and Admin desktop/mobile PASS; account switching and unauthorized route guards PASS; console errors 0 and measured horizontal overflow 0.
- Canonical Users baseline: 16. The extra user predates dashboard acceptance, uses a legitimate public-registration pattern and was preserved. Acceptance sessions ended at 0; the isolated database and all temporary services/artifacts were removed.

TASK-008 was not started.
