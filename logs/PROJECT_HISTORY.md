- 2026-07-16: Canonical `GYMFIT_DB` migration `0006` applied after verified checksum backup. Pending migrations reached 0; Products 167, Users 15, Orders 1 preserved. Temporary smoke sessions were revoked; refresh/logout smoke remained inconclusive.
- 2026-07-16: GYMFIT Command Center authenticated acceptance passed for Member, Coach and Admin desktop/mobile, account switching and route guards. The prior login timeout was a test-harness/process-context defect; source was unchanged. User 16 was preserved as a legitimate pre-acceptance public registration, establishing canonical Users baseline 16. The isolated database, sessions, services and artifacts were cleaned.
